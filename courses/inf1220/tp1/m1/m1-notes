These actions can be mathematical (e.g., sum = a + b), control-based (e.g., IF a > b THEN), or iterative (e.g., WHILE a > b DO).

>What is an algorithm 
An algorithm is a finite and ordered sequence of instructions for solving a problem or accomplishing a specific task. It is a systematic, precisely defined method that guarantees a correct result when executed.

>What is pseudocode 
An algorithm is a method for solving a problem, while pseudocode is a tool for expressing that algorithm clearly and universally

>The loop
A function must always produce the same value given the same data. An algorithm is not limited in this way. For example, an algorithm could be used to randomly choose a name from a list.

Most algorithms in practice are iterative. An iteration is the repetition of a process.

loop: we perform a given task as long as a condition is not met
