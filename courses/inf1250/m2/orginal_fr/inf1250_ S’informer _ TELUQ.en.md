Module 2: Database Concepts, Relational Model and Database Management Systems

Get informed
              Presentation
              This activity consists of the active study of three reference texts relating to the concepts of databases, the relational model, and
              finally, on database management systems (DBMS).

You should not limit yourself to quick and superficial reading of texts. Study it by continually referring to the objectives of the
              module 2. The examples given in each text will also help you better integrate the concepts explored there. Three
              PowerPoint supports directly linked to the three chapters covered are available.

Step by step…
              Study the text…2.1 “…Database Concepts…”

Author
              Jean-Luc Hainaut

Title
              Database concepts

Presentation
              This text discusses the structure of data by using the example of purchase orders introduced in module 1 (text 1.1.). You
              learn the graphic conventions for representing the diagram of a comic strip. The characteristics of the data structures brought by
              relational DBMSs are described there. Finally, the extraction and modification of data will be detailed by introducing the notion of constraint
              of integrity.

Targeted themes (in order)
              Tables, rows, columns and scope;
              null;
              Identifiers (primary and secondary);
              Foreign keys;
              Diagram and content of a comic strip;
              Creation, deletion and modification (uniqueness constraints and referential constraints);
              Cases of more complex structures…: redundancy of information;
              Decomposition of a table to eliminate internal redundancies…: normalization.

Study text 2.2 “…Relational model and standardization…”

Author
              Jean-Luc Hainaut

Title
              Relational model and standardization

Presentation
              This text first addresses the disappearance of internal redundancy thanks to the standardization process, already mentioned in text 2.1. In
              taking up the notion of identifier, the notion of functional dependence will then be presented.
              The relational model will be explained in this text. The mathematical warm-up proposed in this module (Check and practice section) will help you
              will help you understand the text better. Appendices 3 and 25 of the Hainaut book are also resources to consult.

Targeted themes (in order)
              Internal redundancy;
              Data extraction operators;
              Projection of a relationship;
              Natural join of two relationships;
              Line selection;
              Combination of operators;
              Return to identifiers to better understand functional dependencies (DF);
              Functional dependencies (elementary or minimal);
              ADF graphs;
              Inclusion constraints and foreign keys;
              The decomposition and normalization of a relationship (continuation of text 2.1).

              Study text 2.3 “…Database management systems…”

Author
              Jean-Luc Hainaut

Title
              Database management systems

Presentation
              This text deals specifically with database management systems (DBMS).

Topics covered (in order)
              DBMS functions;
              DBMS architecture;
              Transactions (with the four properties of query execution, following the acronym ACID);
              Competing transactions and their regulation;
              Distributed vs centralized comics (on a server).
