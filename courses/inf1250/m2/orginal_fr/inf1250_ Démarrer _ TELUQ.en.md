Module 2: Database Concepts, Relational Model and Database Management Systems

Start
              This module is made up of three sub-parts.

The first part allows you to understand the concepts associated with databases.

The second part concerns the relational model which constitutes the heart of relational databases.

Finally, the third part will target database management systems (DBMS) by delving into their architecture.

You may need a refresher on set theory and logic. For this, appendix 25 of the Hainaut book
              will be useful. You can also practice the mathematical warm-up proposed in part 2.4

Objectives
              At the end of this module, you should be able to:

develop a relational data schema;
                    use relational algebra to exploit a data pattern;
                    to identify and express integrity constraints.

Practical work
              Practical work 1 consists of designing a relational data schema and using relational algebra operations on this model
              to respond to different queries. This work counts for 15% of the final grade.
