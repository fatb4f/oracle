# Oracle monorepo

`oracle` is the primary OTEL-native package for Evidence-First DSA workflows.

Start here:
* `docs/basic_usage.md` for repo layout and dependency rules.
* `docs/configuration_and_settings.md` for environment and OTEL exporter config.
* `docs/dev_flow.md` for VS Code and Marimo execution workflow.
* `docs/otel_migration/replacement_mapping.md` for legacy migration mapping.

Deprecated:
* `oracle_api` and `oracle_tools` remain in-repo only for migration compatibility
  and are not the primary setup/import path.

## MVP bootstrap

Use UV for a reproducible local toolchain (including Marimo and adapter test deps):

```bash
./scripts/mvp_bootstrap.sh
```

Run all suites (core integration + extra migration compatibility):

```bash
./scripts/mvp_tests.sh
```

Install VS Code extension recommendations (Python + Codex IDE extension):

```bash
./scripts/install_vscode_extensions.sh
```

Launch Marimo:

```bash
uv run marimo edit
```
